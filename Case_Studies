## Case Study 1: Critical SLA Breach Investigation

###  Business Problem
The support team was experiencing customer dissatisfaction due to delayed ticket resolutions, but the exact scale and pattern of SLA failures was unclear.

###  Approach
- Created SLA status logic using turnaround time threshold (8 hours).
- Built pivot views by agent, issue type, and region.
- Developed KPI cards to monitor breach percentage.
- Applied conditional formatting to visually flag risks.

###  Key Findings
- Overall SLA breach rate is **82.38%**, indicating systemic delay.
- All regions and issue types show consistently poor SLA performance.
- Majority of tickets fall in **5–12 hours and beyond**, exceeding targets.

###  Business Impact
- Identified SLA risk as **process-wide**, not team-specific.
- Enabled leadership to prioritize workflow optimization.
- Highlighted need for proactive SLA monitoring.

### Recommendations
- Implement real-time SLA alert system.
- Introduce priority-based ticket routing.
- Review staffing and queue management.

##  Case Study 2: Resolution Time Bottleneck Analysis

### Business Problem
Management needed to understand which ticket categories were driving longer resolution times.

### Approach
- Created resolution time buckets using IFS logic.
- Built issue-type level pivots.
- Compared average resolution times across categories.

### Key Findings
- **Login Issues (~21 hrs)** and **Password Reset (~20 hrs)** have the highest resolution times.
- Authentication-related tickets form a major portion of workload.
- Simpler issues (Bug Report, Email Issue) resolve significantly faster.

### Business Impact
- Revealed authentication workflow as primary bottleneck.
- Provided direction for process automation opportunities.
- Helped prioritize high-impact improvement areas.

### Recommendations
- Automate password reset workflows.
- Create self-service authentication tools.
- Develop dedicated queue for login-related issues.

##  Case Study 3: Agent Workload & Productivity Analysis

###  Business Problem
Ticket distribution and agent productivity levels were not clearly visible, making resource planning difficult.

###  Approach
- Built agent-wise pivot tables.
- Compared resolved vs open workload.
- Analyzed regional distribution by agent.

### Key Findings
- **Agent C** handled the highest volume (~175 tickets).
- **Agent E** has the lowest workload (~136 tickets).
- Ticket distribution shows mild imbalance across agents.
- Open ticket backlog stands at **~30%**.

###  Business Impact
- Identified opportunity for workload rebalancing.
- Highlighted potential skill gaps.
- Improved visibility into team performance.

###  Recommendations
- Rebalance ticket allocation across agents.
- Upskill lower-volume agents.
- Implement performance-based routing.

## Case Study 4: Global Demand Pattern Analysis

### Business Problem
Leadership wanted to know whether ticket demand was driven by specific regions.

### Approach
- Built region-wise pivots.
- Compared issue distribution across geographies.
- Analyzed regional SLA patterns.

### Key Findings
- Americas contribute **~53% of total tickets**.
- North America is the single largest contributor.
- Issue mix is **consistent globally**.
- SLA underperformance is uniform across regions.

### Business Impact
- Confirmed demand is globally distributed.
- Ruled out region-specific process issues.
- Enabled globally standardized improvement strategy.

### Recommendations
- Maintain global support model.
- Focus on process improvements rather than regional changes.
- Monitor Americas for future capacity planning.
